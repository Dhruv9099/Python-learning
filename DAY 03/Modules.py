# Python Modules
# A module is the same as a code library.

# A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.module we just created, by using the import statement:
#MATH MODULE

import math

# Calling function from imported module
print("Math factorial: ", math.factorial(5))
a= math.tan(45.0)
print(a)
